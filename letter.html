    <p>Dear Rasmalai,</p>
    <p>Damn… 3 months!!! 3 whole months with the love of my life. Life has never been this sweet to me. Navadha, everything feels different with you. A girl who wasn’t open with anyone else, but gave me her utmost attention… spending days and nights chatting with me on Snapchat How could I not fall in love with you?</p>
    <p>That day when you said yes feels like yesterday, but here we are, celebrating 3 months. And oh my god, this month was peak. Yes, a few lows, but what matters is how close we’ve become. Soo dirty baapre. Your curves, your beauty, the way you love me even when I’m insecure about myself… it’s crazy. You make me feel enough, more than enough, every single day.</p>
    <p>And honestly, I can’t stop loving every little thing about you from the texts you send, to the snaps, the reels, the saree pics (and the secret ones too 😏). They mean the world to me.</p>
    <p>You’ve made me fall in love with you madly, and I feel blessed every single day to call you mine. Three months down… I can’t wait for 3 years, and then forever with you.</p>
    <p>So, baby — happy 3 months of lovey-dovey wala pyaar. I love you sooo much.</p>
    <p>Yours always,<br>Mr. Gadhedo ❤️</p>

    <p>My Dearest Navadha,</p>
    <p>I still remember the very first day we started talking, how nervous I was, and yet how naturally everything just clicked between us. From that moment, I felt like I’d found someone truly special, someone who would change my life in ways I didn’t even know I needed. And now, three months later, I can honestly say… you’ve completely stolen my heart, my thoughts, and even my every little daydream.</p>
    <p>Every moment with you feels like magic. Your smile… it’s like sunlight breaking through the clouds, warming every corner of my soul. Your laugh… I could listen to it forever, and it would still make my heart skip a beat. I love the way you look at me, the way your eyes shine when you’re excited or happy, the way you blush when I tease you it’s irresistible. I love imagining your soft lips against mine, the warmth of your body next to me, and how perfect it feels to just hold you close.</p>
    <p>Navadha, I love every little detail about you the way you get shy sometimes, the way you care so deeply for others, even the way you tease me back when I’m being flirty. I love how strong you are, how you’ve dealt with everything life threw at you, and yet you still have this softness, this tenderness, that makes me want to protect you, cherish you, and spoil you forever.

You are not just my girlfriend; you are my best friend, my confidante, my partner-in-crime, and the one I want to share every moment with.</p>
    <p>I can’t stop thinking about all the fun, flirty, and cheeky times we’ve shared. I love teasing you, seeing you blush, feeling your hands on me, and imagining all the secret little moments we haven’t even had yet. I want to explore every part of you, laugh with you, kiss you until you can’t stop smiling, and create memories that are just ours. Even when we’re apart, every thought of you makes my heart race and my mind wander to all the ways I want to make you feel loved, adored, and wanted.</p>
    <p>I also love the comfort we share the way we can talk about anything, how I can be completely myself around you, and how you accept me for everything I am. That trust, that bond, is rare, and I’ll never take it for granted. I want to always be the one you can lean on, the one who lifts you up when you’re down, the one who makes you feel safe and cherished in every way.</p>
    <p>And let’s be honest… I love teasing you, feeling your reactions, imagining you next to me, and all the naughty little fantasies we’ve shared. It’s playful, it’s fun, and it makes our connection so alive and electric. I love thinking about our secret moments, our stolen kisses, our whispered confessions, and how perfect it feels when it’s just you and me, lost in our little world.</p>
    <p>Navadha, these three months have been the happiest of my life. You’ve become the center of my world, my heart, my everything. I can’t wait to spend more time with you, to laugh, to love, to tease, and to hold you close. I want to show you every day just how much I love you not just in words, but in every touch, every glance, and every shared moment.</p>
    <p>Thank you for being you, for letting me love you, and for making my life brighter in ways I never imagined. I promise to always be there for you, to make you smile, to make you feel desired and adored, and to hold you close through every high and low. I can’t imagine my life without you, Navadha you complete me in ways I didn’t even know I needed.</p>
    <p>Here’s to us, to our love, to our crazy flirty moments, our emotional talks, our laughter, our kisses, and every single memory we’ll make together. I love you more than words could ever express, and I’ll spend every day proving it to you.</p>
    <p>Forever yours,<br>Gadhedo</p>
