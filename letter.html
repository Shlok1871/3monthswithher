    <p>Dear Rasmalai,</p>
    <p>Damn… 3 months!!! 3 whole months with the love of my life. Life has never been this sweet to me. Navadha, everything feels different with you. A girl who wasn’t open with anyone else, but gave me her utmost attention… spending days and nights chatting with me on Snapchat How could I not fall in love with you?</p>
    <p>That day when you said yes feels like yesterday, but here we are, celebrating 3 months. And oh my god, this month was peak. Yes, a few lows, but what matters is how close we’ve become. Soo dirty baapre. Your curves, your beauty, the way you love me even when I’m insecure about myself… it’s crazy. You make me feel enough, more than enough, every single day.</p>
    <p>And honestly, I can’t stop loving every little thing about you from the texts you send, to the snaps, the reels, the saree pics (and the secret ones too 😏). They mean the world to me.</p>
    <p>You’ve made me fall in love with you madly, and I feel blessed every single day to call you mine. Three months down… I can’t wait for 3 years, and then forever with you.</p>
    <p>So, baby — happy 3 months of lovey-dovey wala pyaar. I love you sooo much.</p>
    <p>Yours always,<br>Mr. Gadhedo ❤️</p>
